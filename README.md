# Cosm

A package for constructing interactive, navigable, sonified virtual worlds using Max/MSP/Jitter.

This software was originally written for Max 5, and some parts were superceded by additions to Max 6 and Max 7, however it remains in use so it has now been restructured here into the newer Max package format.

There are plans to update *Cosm* to reflect new possibilities in Max 7; which will be added here as and when is possible.
